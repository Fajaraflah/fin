        <h2>Performance Disclosures</h2>
        <p>
          Each comparative benchmark is a mix of total return for a portfolio of
          exchange traded funds intended to represent a blend of five major
          asset classes: US Equities, International Equities, US Bonds,
          International Bonds and Alternatives. Asset allocations of the
          comparative benchmarks are similar to respective Personal Strategies
          and serve as a reasonable benchmark for a basic long-term diversified
          approach with a similar risk level. All Personal Strategy returns are
          net of fees. The respective blended benchmark allocations, individual
          strategy assignment, and associated rebalancing are characteristics of
          a professionally managed portfolio. As such, a hypothetical quarterly
          fee of 0.2075% was deducted from all comparative benchmark returns
          except those used for Tactical America, which is a single asset class.
          This represents the average fee of all Clients at the time it was
          calculated in June 2017.

        <p>
          For each composite personal strategy, quarterly and annual figures for
          2012 were calculated as an average of actual client portfolio returns
          within those respective strategies. Only accounts trading for the full
          calendar year were included. For Q4, 2011, only accounts trading for
          the full quarter were included. For both composite personal strategies
          and comparative benchmarks, full year, year to date, and since
          inception returns are derived by linking respective quarterly returns.
          Past performance is not a guarantee of future return, nor is it
          necessarily indicative of future performance. All investments involve
          risk, including the potential for loss of principal. Performance is
          shown net of fees and reflects the reinvestment of interest and
          dividends. Personal Strategies generally employ investments in an
          array of individual securities and ETFs representing domestic
          equities, international equities fixed income and alternative
          investments such as real estate and commodities. ETF-only strategies
          were not considered in performance calculations. Accounts in the
          composite are billed on a tiered fee schedule and larger accounts
          generally pay a lower overall fee rate than other accounts. Prior to
          2019, accounts with greater than ten percent individual custom
          restrictions resulting in greater than two percent difference in
          performance results were not included in composites. Post 2019, all
          portfolios deviating more than two percent from the median composite
          return, in either direction, were excluded. Individual account
          performance will vary depending upon the amount of assets under
          management and the timing of any additions and withdrawals and may be
          higher or lower than the performance depicted. Performance for
          employee and other affiliated accounts has been recalculated to
          reflect full, standard fee schedules.

          The Investment Checkup is intended to provide insight based on the
          accounts you have aggregated on the Personal Capital dashboard and
          other information you have provided. Because there is no way to know
          all information about your finances or your personal situation,
          comments or analyses may be incomplete or inaccurate. All insight
          provided represents a courtesy extended to you for educational purpose
          and you should not rely on this information as the primary basis of
          your investment, financial, or tax planning decisions. You should

        <p>
          Comparative analysis, including Monte Carlo analysis, is intended to
          illustrate hypothetical performance of various allocation strategies
          based on a long-term historical asset class performance and is not
          meant to imply actual performance or results.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much of the analysis does not include taxes or fees, which can have a
          material impact. It is not possible to invest directly in an index
          without incurring expenses, which will lower the actual return.

        <h2>Retirement Fee Analyzer Calculations Disclosure</h2>
        <p>
          There are many elements to retirement fees, some are more clearly
          disclosed than others. The key components to the costs associated with
          retirement accounts are:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            The fees for the funds that you are invested in. These are indicated
            in the expense ratio column and are based on the fees as disclosed
            by the fund providers.
          </li>
          <li>
            Plan administrative and advice fees. These are the fees that are
            passed on to you from the plan administrator and cover record
            keeping and advice. They can range from 0% in very large plans, to
            over 1% in plans for smaller companies. We provide a slider that you
            can move to represent the fees charged by your plan administrator.
            You can change this number to match your plan administrative and
            advice fee. For 401k’s, this data should be available in the
            recently required disclosure statement or from your company's
            benefits administrator.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unpublished fund fee data. Specialty funds sometimes charge fees
            that can range from 0.5% to over 3% and are not plainly disclosed.
            For 401k’s, this data should be available in the recently required
            401k disclosures statement and on your plan administrator’s website.
            We allow you to set the fund fees for the group of funds for which
            there is no publicly available data.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          We use your current age and selected investment account balances as a
          starting point for estimating the impact of fees on your retirement
          goals. We factor in the typical retirement age, expected future
          contributions (employee and employer), an estimate of inflation and
          return on investment based on historical trends, matching or
          supplemental contributions from your company and spouse, and lastly
          fund, administrative and advice fees, some of which are based on
          specific funds you currently own in your account(s). From this data we
          calculate your estimated total retirement contributions, earnings, and
          the effect of fees on your total return over time and present this
          information graphically so you can easily see what you would have in
          retirement before and after fees. The information provided is for
          informational purposes only and is based on certain assumptions and
          historical data. No guarantee is made with respect to performance. You
          may wish to seek the advice of a professional in planning your
          retirement.
        </p>

        <h2>Retirement Planner Disclosures</h2>
        <p>
          The calculations in the Retirement Planner are based solely on
          information provided by the user, data based on the accounts that
          users have aggregated on the Personal Capital dashboard, historical
          market returns, and the assumptions shown or selected. Because there
          is no way to know all information about your finances or your personal
          situation, analysis may be incomplete or inaccurate. All insight
          provided represents a courtesy extended to you for illustrative
          purposes only and you should not rely on this information as the
          primary basis of your investment, financial, or tax planning
          decisions. No representations, warranties, or guarantees are made as
          to the accuracy of any estimates or calculations. Personal Capital is
          not liable for any damages or costs of any type arising out of or in
          any way connected with your use of this calculator. The information
          provided in Retirement Planner does not serve, either directly or
          indirectly, as legal, financial, or tax advice and you should always
          consult a qualified professional legal, financial, and tax advisor for
          your specific situation.
        </p>
        <h4>Calculation Assumptions</h4>
        <p>
          This Retirement Planner tool is intended to provide a basic sense of
          how your portfolio may grow and support your stated spending goals. It
          also gives you an easy way to see how adjustments to the most
          important variables (saving rate, spending rate and retirement age)
          can impact you. All results are presented in today’s dollars,
          inflation adjusted at 3.5%, unless changed by the user. Projections
          utilize Monte Carlo simulation, with the median scenario and 10% worst
          cash scenarios highlighted. The portfolio survival percentage
          represents the percent of the simulations which ended at age 92 or the
          selected life expectancy age, with a balance above $0. Growth and
          volatility assumptions are based on historical asset class returns and
          correlations using the users’ aggregated asset allocation or a
          moderate, well-diversified asset allocation with 8.4% annual return
          and 11.4% standard deviation of return, if not available.

          Gold Council, BP.com, US Energy Information Administration, Robert
          Shiller Online, MIT Center For Real Estate, Yahoo Finance.
          Calculations are based on the long-term historical performance of
          asset class proxies: S&amp;P 500, MSCI EAFE until 2000 and MSCI ACWI
          ex-US post 2000, 10 Year U.S. Treasuries, 10 Year Foreign Government
          Bonds, and 30 Day T-Bills. Alternative asset class represented by a
          hypothetical index of 50% real estate and a 50% gold/oil combination.
          Portfolio standard deviation, correlation, and expected returns are

          Returns do not account for fees or trading costs. It is not possible
          to invest directly in an index. We chose a default inflation number
          higher than current levels to help account for low current interest
          rates which may lead to lower future investment returns, as well as
          the impact of fees. For simplicity, we assume no taxes on portfolio
          growth, but tax all portfolio withdrawals (spending above income) at
          20% unless edited by the user. While not precise, we believe this is
          an effective way to roughly approximate the impact of taxes regardless
          of the composition of assets in taxable or tax-deferred retirement
          accounts.
