But it's possible, and quite common. Here's what to do if you have an overfunded 529 account.","articleBody":"With outstanding student loans now exceeding one trillion dollars, there\u2019s a big emphasis on what can be done to relieve families of the burden of student loan debt. However, some families face another problem \u2013 they saved too much money in a 529 college savings plan. That\u2019s right \u2014 it\u2019s actually possible to save more money than is needed to pay for college education expenses. And it\u2019s more common than you might think. For example, if you saved for four years of private schooling in a 529, and your child decides to go to a community college for a couple years and then transfer to a state school, you\u2019ll end up with remaining funds in your account.\r\n\r\nSo why is this a problem? Because there are tax consequences if 529 funds are used to pay for anything other than qualified education expenses. Specifically, the earnings portion of a 529 account is subject to taxation as ordinary income and a 10 percent penalty if money is used for non-education related expenses. However, withdrawals of principal won\u2019t be taxed or penalized because contributions were made with after-tax dollars.\r\n\r\nA Good Problem to Have\r\nGranted, this is a good \u201cproblem\u201d to have for many people \u2014 it\u2019s certainly much better than racking up tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in student loan debt. But what are your alternatives if your son or daughter has finished college (or decided not to attend college) and there\u2019s money left over in your 529 plan?\r\n\r\nHere are 5 options to consider:\r\n\r\n1. Keep the money in the account to pay for grad school later.\r\nsome point, leaving the remaining funds in your 529 might not be a bad option. Many young adults decide to pursue advanced education after obtaining a four-year undergraduate degree. There\u2019s no timeline dictating when 529 funds have to be withdrawn, so if there\u2019s a chance your son or daughter might want to go to graduate school later, you can just leave excess 529 funds alone. \r\n\r\nAs an added benefit, the money may continue to grow on a tax-deferred basis as long as it remains in the account.\r\n\r\n2. Change the beneficiary.\r\n529 plans offer a lot of flexibility in terms of beneficiary designations. So, if you have more than one child and there\u2019s leftover money in your oldest child\u2019s 529 when he or she graduates, you can simply change the beneficiary designation to your younger child. This could enable you to contribute less money to your younger child\u2019s account and reallocate some of these funds to retirement savings instead.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, you could change the beneficiary to a member of your extended family, such as a niece or nephew. You could even change the beneficiary to yourself and use the money to go back to school and get a graduate degree or attend a vocational-technical school if you want.\r\n\r\n3. Save the money for grandchildren.\r\nSince there isn\u2019t a deadline requiring you to withdraw 529 funds by a certain date, you can leave the money in the account for your children\u2019s children. You would simply designate a grandchild as the new beneficiary once he or she is born. This is a great way to get an early start on college savings for your grandkids, which your children will no doubt greatly appreciate.\r\n\r\n4. Look into penalty-free non-qualified withdrawal options.\r\nThere are several scenarios in which you can make non-qualified 529 plan withdrawals and avoid paying the 10 percent penalty. These include the death or disability of the beneficiary and the decision by the beneficiary to attend a U.S. military academy. Also, if your child receives one or more scholarships, you can withdraw up to the scholarship award amount and use the money for non-education related expenses without paying the 10 percent penalty.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that while you won\u2019t have to pay the tax penalty in these situations, you will still have to pay tax on earnings in the account at your ordinary income tax rate.\r\n\r\n5. Use the money to pay for private K-12 education expenses.\r\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act included a beneficial provision for families saving money in 529 plans by allowing these funds to be used to pay for private secondary school education expenses. So if there\u2019s leftover money in your older child\u2019s 529 when he or she graduates, you can use it to send your younger child or children to a private elementary, middle or high school. \r\n\r\nOur Take\r\nIf none of these strategies work for you, your last option may be to simply withdraw the money and pay the income taxes and penalty that are due. Remember that taxes and penalties are only assessed on your earnings, so the tax bite might not be as drastic as you think.\r\n\r\nTalk to your financial planner about the best strategy for your family\u2019s situation if you have an overfunded 529 account. \r\n\r\nRead More: Personal Capital's Guide to Saving for a Child's Education\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: The information on this website is for informational purposes only and does not constitute a complete description of our investment services or performance.
