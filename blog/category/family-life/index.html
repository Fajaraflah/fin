Read more here to see how you can manage your finances during a pandemic.","articleBody":"Managing your finances isn\u2019t easy. Managing your finances during a global pandemic is even harder. \r\n\r\nMore than ever, I\u2019m getting questions about how I\u2019m managing my own money (as someone who writes and speaks about money for a living). I\u2019m lucky that my income hasn\u2019t taken a huge dip, but I\u2019m definitely not immune to feeling anxious and scared right now like the majority of citizens.\r\n\r\nHere are a few ways I\u2019ve changed my financial situation during this pandemic that may suit you and your current financial situation.\r\n\r\n1. Focusing on building savings\r\nI understand the importance of investing and compound interest. It\u2019s important to continue investing if you have the means to, even when the market is turbulent.\r\n\r\nHowever, because we\u2019re living in unprecedented times, I\u2019m personally prioritizing building savings. Normally, I invest around 20% to 30% of my income. But right now, I\u2019m investing about 10% for long-term goals like retirement. I want to continue to invest, but I also want to make sure I have a little bit of a cash cushion \u2014 in case something unexpected should happen that might disrupt my cash flow, having cash on hand will allow me to access my money more easily should I need it.\r\n\r\nBecause my current portfolio is valued at over $95,000 \u2014 and due to my current age of 25 years old \u2014 I feel more comfortable taking my foot off the gas just a little bit while things are uncertain. I\u2019ve already maxed my Roth IRA and HSA for this year (almost $10,000) so I feel secure in my decision to invest a little less than I normally would and continue to build my savings for unexpected expenses that may arise.\r\n\r\n2. Spending money on take-out\/delivery, and supporting local business\r\nI hardly ever get food delivered, but during quarantine, I\u2019m finding myself doing it at least once a week. Not only does it break up the monotony of cooking, it\u2019s also a great way for me to  support local businesses and restaurants. Because I can\u2019t go out to eat like I normally would, this is a great compromise \u2014 I\u2019m still saving money while supporting the local economy.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also extremely convenient and weirdly comforting to have food delivered to your door or already made when you pick it up. I live alone, so it\u2019s nice when someone else is cooking for me! It\u2019s something I look forward to, in a time where there\u2019s very few \u201cfuture things\u201d that are certain.\r\n\r\n3. Building a larger emergency fund\r\nBefore quarantine started, I had a cash emergency fund of about 6 months\u2019 of living expenses. Because I\u2019m now a full-time business owner, I have to consider how a financial emergency could impact not only my personal finances but also my business.\r\n\r\nAfter paying off my last piece of debt in February of this year, I don\u2019t have to worry about paying anything off. The 20% that I would normally invest has now been cut in half, and I\u2019m funneling 10% to my emergency fund. Now, I feel more comfortable knowing that I have 10-12 months saved in case I need it. It is often advertised to have at least 3-6 months of expenses saved up in an emergency fund, but it may not be a bad idea to hold a bit more during the uncertain times that we are currently experiencing.  \r\n\r\n4. Buying comfort\r\nIt is my opinion there\u2019s nothing wrong with retail therapy. I\u2019m going to say this again: there\u2019s nothing wrong with retail therapy. Especially in an unprecedented global pandemic \u2014 when just trying to exist as a person can be stressful \u2014 don\u2019t blame yourself for online shopping.\r\n\r\nThere are ways to make your online shopping experience less expensive, however. Make sure you\u2019re using free browser extensions to get cash back on your purchases. And if you\u2019re a responsible credit card holder that pays off balances every month, you could put your purchases on your card in order to accumulate points or miles.\r\n\r\nIf you find yourself online shopping too much, focus on asking yourself a few key questions before you make a purchase. \u201cAm I buying this out of routine or boredom?\u201d and \u201cIs this purchase worth it?\u201d can both help put your spending into perspective.\r\n\r\n5. Giving more\r\nI have so much gratitude for being in the financial situation I am currently in. Just like how some people are currently feeling, I feel a responsibility to make sure I\u2019m supporting my friends and community as much as I can. \r\n\r\nMore of my income is going to charities and organizations I believe in. \r\n\r\nIf you are financially stable, consider being generous and understand that those around you, as well as plenty of communities, could need assistance during turbulent times.\r\n\r\nSome Next Steps for You\r\n\r\nUtilize a free online financial tool to get a sense of your full financial picture. When making decisions about how to adjust your financial plan during periods of uncertainty, it's important to first have a 360-degree view of all your money. Personal Capital's free financial tools are a good place to start -- you'll be able to securely link all of your financial accounts to monitor your net worth and cash flow. You can also manage and track your budget, calculate your retirement readiness, and analyze your portfolio.\r\nConsider speaking to a financial advisor before making any major changes to how you handle your finances.\r\n\r\n\r\nSign Up for Free Financial Tools\r\n\r\n\r\n*Personal Capital compensates Tori Dunlap (\u201cAuthor\u201d) for providing the content contained in this blog post.
